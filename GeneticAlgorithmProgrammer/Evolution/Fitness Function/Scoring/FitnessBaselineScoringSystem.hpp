/* The FitnessBaselineScoringSystem class
 is an incomplete interface that should
 be subclassed (do not call any functions
 on this specific class/file - only the
 subclasses). It is a baseline scoring system,
 meaning the primary component of a given
 fitness function that measures accuracy or
 cost. It can be then layered with heuristics.
 Each fitness baseline scoring system instance
 contains a "goal state" that is the criteria of
 the accuracy function, and you pass "predictions"
 on that goal state which will be scored.
