/*
 A chromosome population is a population
 of chromosomes within some given generation
 or arbitrary time frame / index. The population
 deals with the spawning, mating, and killing
 (via natural selection) of chromosomes in its
 member pool. The population is constantly changing
 and derived from the fittest of the previous.
