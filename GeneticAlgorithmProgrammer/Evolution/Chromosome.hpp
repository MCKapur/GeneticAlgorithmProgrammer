/* A chromosome is an object that stores the
 piece of data (the "genome") that is being
 evolved (via mating and random mutations)
 to match some desired output. Each chromosome
 is a species in its population (breed), and
 is either killed from the system or evolved
 further due to natural selection in the population,
 based on the fitness function and how it compares
 to its competitors. */
